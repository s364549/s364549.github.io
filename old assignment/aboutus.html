        &lrm;To ensure universal accessibility, we researched the page structure concepts in the suggested 
        resources from w3.org (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/">Web Accessibility Initiative, 2019</a>). Since clearly listing the food allergens is a requirement, we read the 
        allergen guidance (<a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/business-guidance/allergen-guidance-for-food-businesses">Food Standards Agency, 2020</a>) for food businesses from the UK government. We also visited certain websites 
        which we consider well designed in terms of accessibility, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a>, then used 
        ‘inspect element’ to understand the way their website elements are constructed. 
        We also found accessibility principles from w3(<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/">Web Accessibility Initiative, 2021</a>), and designed accordingly as far as we could. 
        Our focus is primarily ensuring full keyboard access to the website, since the users we have in 
        mind really are everybody, and we figure accounting for those who use assistive technologies 
        such as screen readers will make the biggest difference regarding accessibility. Throughout the 
        development process, we debated the inclusion of every single element we added. Since we want to 
        ensure clarity, appropriate design means omitting unnecessary website elements which could 
        interfere with screen readers, so we considered intentional design to be important. 
        For instance, we have given every visual representation such as pictures its corresponding text 
        description. Another feature that we believe provides the most significant return on user 
        accessibility is the ability to easily navigate the site using a keyboard only. 
        The user segment we had in mind includes those who have medical conditions that prevent them 
        from using the mouse. Therefore, we made sure to include a keyboard focus in every flexbox at 
        all times, and tested to ensure there were no keyboard navigation traps and checking efficient keyboard 
        access.

        &lrm;Submitting our first draft to AChecker gave us only potential errors aside from missing 
        <code>alt</code> attributes on our menu photos, which we naturally added. The alt description of <code>facade.jpg</code> 
        was not descriptive enough, so we rewrote it to include the text in the image. As suggested, we 
        lengthened the figcaption. To identify the text direction, we used the <code>dir</code> attribute of the <code>html</code> 
        element, and added the unicode marker <code>&#38;lrm&#59;</code> to each piece of text content. We were advised to 
        add “skip to content” links, and our solution was adding an additional navigation bar in <code>menu.html</code>, 
        which contains nested unordered lists. The dish names whose purpose was to facilitate keyboard 
        navigation were changed to skip to their corresponding course section when clicked. To account for 
        narrower device screens, we used a media query to disable <code>display&#58; flex</code> and display the menu map and 
        footer content as regular lists. We changed the “PETUNIA” link in the navigation bar to a more 
        descriptive “HOME”. We had used uppercase letters for the restaurant title in <code>index.html</code>, and 
        since best practices suggest solely using CSS for formatting, we instead added a CSS rule to text 
        transform all <code>h1</code> elements to uppercase. We added a top right toggle button for the user to 
        view a dark mode version of our site. Finally, we took the opportunity to add a subtle thematically 
        appropriate floral background and a corresponding one for dark mode, to make the site more aesthetically pleasing.
