    <h1>About us</h1>
    <div class="info" id="infotext">
      <p>
        To ensure universal accessibility, we researched the page structure concepts in the suggested 
        resources from <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/">w3.org</a>. Since clearly listing the food allergens is a requirement, we read the 
        <a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/business-guidance/allergen-guidance-for-food-businesses">allergen guidance</a> for food businesses from the UK government. We also visited certain websites 
        which we consider well designed in terms of accessibility, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a>, then used 
        ‘inspect element’ to understand the way their website elements are constructed. 
        We also found <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/">accessibility principles from w3</a>, and designed accordingly as far as we could. 
        Our focus is primarily ensuring full keyboard access to the website, since the users we have in 
        mind really are everybody, and we figure accounting for those who use assistive technologies 
        such as screen readers will make the biggest difference regarding accessibility. Throughout the 
        development process, we debated the inclusion of every single element we added. Since we want to 
        ensure clarity, appropriate design means omitting unnecessary website elements which could 
        interfere with screen readers, so we considered intentional design to be important. 
        For instance, we have given every visual representation such as pictures its corresponding text 
        description. Another feature that we believe provides the most significant return on user 
        accessibility is the ability to easily navigate the site using a keyboard only. 
        The user segment we had in mind includes those who have medical conditions that prevent them 
        from using the mouse. Therefore, we made sure to include a keyboard focus in every flexbox at 
        all times, and tested to ensure there were no keyboard navigation traps and efficient keyboard 
        access.(...)
